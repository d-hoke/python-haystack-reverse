Quick Start:
============
[Haystack-reverse CLI](docs/Haystack_reverse_CLI.ipynb) in the docs/ folder.

Introduction:
=============

python-haystack-reverse is extension of [python-haystack](https://github.com/trolldbois/python-haystack) focused on 
reversing memory structure in allocated memory.

 - It aims at helping an analyst in reverse engineering the memory records types present in a process heap.
It focuses on reconstruction, classification of classic C structures from memory. 
It attempts to recreate types definition.

Scripts & Entry Points:
=======================

A few entry points exists to handle the format your memory dump.

Memory dump folder produced by `haystack-live-dump` from the haystack package
---------------------------------------------------
 - `haystack-reverse` reverse CLI - reverse all allocation chunks
 - `haystack-reverse-show` show the reversed record at a specific address
 - `haystack-reverse-hex` show a specific record hex bytes at a specific address
 - `haystack-reverse-parents` show the records pointing to the allocated record at a specific address

Memory dump file produced by a Minidump tool
---------------------------------------------------
 - `haystack-minidump-reverse` reverse CLI - reverse all allocation chunks
 - `haystack-minidump-reverse-show` show the reversed record at a specific address
 - `haystack-minidump-reverse-hex` show a specific record hex bytes at a specific address
 - `haystack-minidump-reverse-parents` show the records pointing to the allocated record at a specific address

How to get a memory dump:
=========================

See [python-haystack](https://github.com/trolldbois/python-haystack) or use Sysinternals procdump.

Heap analysis / forensics:
==========================

Quick info:
 - The `haystack-xxx-reverse` family of entry points parse the heap for 
 allocator structures, pointers values, small integers and text (ascii/utf).
 Given all the previous information, it can extract instances and helps you 
 in classifying and defining structures types.

IPython notebook usage guide:
 - [Haystack-reverse CLI](docs/Haystack reverse CLI.ipynb) in the docs/ folder.

Command line example:
--------------------
The first step is to launch the analysis process with the `haystack-xxx-reverse` entry point.
This will create several files in the `cache/` folder in the memory dump folder:

    $ haystack-reverse haystack/test/src/test-ctypes6.64.dump
    $ ls -l haystack/test/src/test-ctypes6.64.dump/cache
    $ ls -l haystack/test/src/test-ctypes6.64.dump/cache/structs

This will create a few files. The most interesting one being the `<yourdumpfolder>/cache/xxxxx.headers_values.py` that
gives you an ctypes listing of all found structures, with guesstimates
on fields types.

A `<yourdumpfolder>/cache/graph.gexf` file is also produced to help you visualize
instances links. It gets messy for any kind of serious application.

- `*.headers_values.py` contains the list of heuristicly reversed record types.
- `*.strings` contains the list of heuristicly typed strings field in reversed record.

Other Entry points for reversing:
--------------------------------

 - `haystack-reverse-show` show a specific record at a specific address
 - `haystack-reverse-hex` show a specific record hex bytes at a specific address
 - `haystack-reverse-parents` show the records pointing to the allocated record at a specific address
 - `haystack-minidump-reverse-show` show a specific record at a specific address
 - `haystack-minidump-reverse-hex` show a specific record hex bytes at a specific address
 - `haystack-minidump-reverse-parents` show the records pointing to the allocated record at a specific address
